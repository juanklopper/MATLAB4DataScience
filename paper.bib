	abstract = {Linked administrative databases offer a powerful resource for studying important public health issues. Methods developed and implemented in several jurisdictions across the globe have achieved high-quality linkages for conducting health and social research without compromising confidentiality. Key data available for linkage include health services utilization, population registries, place of residence, family ties, educational outcomes, and use of social services. Linking events for large populations of individuals across disparate sources and over time permits a range of research possibilities, including the capacity to study low-prevalence exposure-disease associations, multiple outcome domains within the same cohort of individuals, service utilization and chronic disease patterns, and life course and transgenerational transmission of health. Limited information on variables such as individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) and social supports is outweighed by strengths that include comprehensive follow-up, continuous data collection, objective measures, and relatively low expense. Ever advancing methodologies and data holdings guarantee that research using linked administrative databases will make increasingly important contributions to public health research.},

	abstract = {Timely implementation of principles of evidence-based public health (EBPH) is critical for bridging the gap between discovery of new knowledge and its application. Public health organizations need sufficient capacity (the availability of resources, structures, and workforce to plan, deliver, and evaluate the preventive dose of an evidence-based intervention) to move science to practice. We review principles of EBPH, the importance of capacity building to advance evidence-based approaches, promising approaches for capacity building, and future areas for research and practice. Although there is general agreement among practitioners and scientists on the importance of EBPH, there is less clarity on the definition of evidence, how to find it, and how, when, and where to use it. Capacity for EBPH is needed among both individuals and organizations. Capacity can be strengthened via training, use of tools, technical assistance, assessment and feedback, peer networking, and incentives. Modest investments in EBPH capacity building will foster more effective public health practice.},

	abstract = {The past few years have seen the emergence of claims that the political determinants of health do not get due consideration and a growing demand for better insights into public policy analysis in the health research field. Several public health and health promotion researchers are calling for better training and a stronger research culture in health policy. The development of these studies tends to be more advanced in health promotion than in other areas of public health research, but researchers are still commonly caught in a naïve, idealistic and narrow view of public policy. This article argues that the political science discipline has developed a specific approach to public policy analysis that can help to open up unexplored levers of influence for public health research and practice and that can contribute to a better understanding of public policy as a determinant of health. It describes and critiques the public health model of policy analysis, analyzes political science's specific approach to public policy analysis, and discusses how the politics of research provides opportunities and barriers to the integration of political science's distinctive contributions to policy analysis in health promotion.},

	title = {Beyond {Data} {Scientists}: a {Review} of {Big} {Data} {Skills} and {Job} {Families}},
	shorttitle = {Beyond {Data} {Scientists}},
	abstract = {Purpose – This paper promises to shed light on the heterogeneous nature of the skills required to ‘win’ with Big Data by analysing a large amount of job posts published online. More specifically we: 1) identify the most important ‘job families’ related to Big Data; 2) recognize homogeneous groups of skills (skillsets) that are most sought after by companies; 3) characterize each job family with the appropriate level of competence required within each Big Data skillset.

Design/methodology/approach – We implement a semi-automated, fully reproducible, analytical methodology that is able to cope with the significant amount of job posts obtained by scraping some of the most popular job search online portals. Job families are identified through the expert evaluation of the most important keywords appearing in job posts’ titles. Skillsets are instead obtained by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for text classification. Finally, we characterize the job families through a measure of the relative importance of each skillset.

Originality/value – This study represents one of the first attempts to classify jobs in families and describe them in terms of skill requirements by means of a large-scale, semi-automated job post analysis, based on machine learning algorithms. To do so, we propose an original combination of various analytical techniques, which are widely established in previous scientific works. The characterization of job families through text mining and topic modelling techniques is innovative and can be reapplied to similar future studies focusing on any other professional field.

Practical implications – This paper brings clarity to the multifaceted nature of Big Data competency requirements and job role types. Our results can concretely help business leaders and HR managers create clearer strategies for the procurement of the right skills needed to leverage Big Data at best. In addition, the structured classification of job families and skillsets will help establish a common language to be used within the job market, through which supply and demand can more effectively meet.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in data science in general and machine learning in particular have transformed the way experts envision the future of surgery. Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.},

In this complete course I introduce you to the use of MATLAB for Data Science. While there are many courses on MATLAB here on YouTube, very few use Live Scripts. Live Scripts are living research documents and are absolutely great for Data Science. They are the core of reproducible research and science communication. We can use them to share our work with collaborators and with the World.

Each chapter is accompanied by a complete set of notes that you can find at https://github.com/juanklopper/MATLAB... 

There are six chapters in this course and you can find timestamps to each below.

00:05:26 Introducing MATLAB and Live Scripts
