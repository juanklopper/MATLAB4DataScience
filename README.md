# MATLAB4HealthDataScience

This repository contains all the course material for a course in health data science. The course was primarily created for postgraduate students in public health who have taken courses in SAS, Python, and R for data analsyis.

MATLAB is listed as required skill in many data science jobs. In healthcare these jobs tend to be with companies and institutions that includes medical devices and hardware in their services and products.

The course consists of six chapters. Each chapter has complete documentation that is provided as a portable document format (PDF) file and as a MATLAB Live Script file. The latter files are interactive coding envorinments that contains both the learning material and the code. Students can replicate or alter the code as part of their exploration.

The course reviews all concepts related to a data science or research project including how to work with data and import data from a spreadsheet.

Note that MATLAB is prorietary software. Many Colleges, universities, and other institutions have site licences. Find out from you administrator if you have free access to MATLAB.
